        This website is a small collection of the snacks and drinks I grew up with.
        Most of them were things I used to buy after school, when a few coins could
        make you unbelievably happy. Some of these snacks have strange names, some
        taste better in memory than in real life, and many of them do not even exist anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wanted to keep them somewhere, not as a “museum”, just as a tiny shelf
        of my own childhood. A lot of these snacks look ridiculous now, but back then,
        they really were the highlight of my day.
      </p>
      <p>
        These pages are simply my way of remembering what it felt like to be a kid
        buying 1-yuan treats at the school gate.
